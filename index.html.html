  <p>Hello there! I'm a data engineer and a machine learning enthusiast. I enjoy spending time with my cats, playing video games,
  and yoga. I have a Bachelor of Science in Materials Science and Engineering from the University of North Texas and a Data Science
  Certificate from Southern Methodist University.</p>
  <p>I a proficient in Python, JavaScript, and Ruby. I have worked with SQL, APIs, and advanced Excel. I have leadership experience in
    academic and professional settings, leading groups from 3 to 40 in the academic setting, including on a major academic engineering design project,
    and overseeing a workforce of 40 to 70 employees with a team of 4 to 7 other managers, which allowed strong problem solving and task management skills to develop.</p>
